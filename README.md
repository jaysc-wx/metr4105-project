# Meteorological Computer Applications project
Project done for my sophomore Meteorological Computer Apps (METR 4105) class at UNC Charlotte. It uses Fortran for analyzing data and Python for creating graphics inserted into my presentation.

The Fortran code ```Final Project.f90``` reads in five soundings and five CF6 files relevant to landfalling or impactful tropical cyclones to the Charleston, SC area. Python graphics were created using MetPy's declarative plotting syntax. Files have not been edited at this time. The presentation supplementing the analysis has been included.
